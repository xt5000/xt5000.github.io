I'm Kristina Hines! I'm concentrating in Illustration, and took this class as an introduction to many of the digital tools I'll need to use. This site displays all my class projects - they were challenging and interesting, and I can't wait to use them more in the future!

photoshop
I liked Photoshop a lot, I found it to be the most intuitive of the Creative Cloud programs. I'm looking forward to using it more for digital painting and illustration.

illustrator
Illustrator was not as intuitive for me personally, but I appreciate the power it has and the elegance of the features like the Bezier handle. Illustrator makes it so easy to create polished work.

animate
Animate was incredibly challenging for me. Although I did find the results that you can get with it to be very impressive, I think I'll stick to still images! Enjoy this chipper scene, it's likely the last narrative animation I'll ever make!

indesign
InDesign has many elegant time-saving features, which I appreciated but which somehow seemed to work only about 50% of the time for me. I wonder if there are background settings that I toggled to an unhelpful mode - I'm sure I'll figure it out in the future, because I am likely going to be using it alot for e-publishing.
