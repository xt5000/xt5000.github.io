An unnamed Russian kitty has become a YouTube sensation thanks to its obsessed interest with a vacuum cleaner. The enthralled feline appears to be tasting some unseen bit of deliciousness on the end of the vacuum cleaner, and, as the kitty goes in for a lick, the hose attaches itself to the cat’s face. Despite the apparent unprovoked attack by the vacuum cleaner, the cat goes in for another taste. The YouTube video titled Кот и пылесос has already racked up more than 2.48 million views. Cat videos are huge on YouTube, and, given the meteoric rise of this new video, it looks as if a simple cat battling with a vacuum cleaner could soon become one of the most watch YouTube cat videos of all time.
